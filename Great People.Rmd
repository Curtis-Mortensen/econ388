## Great People


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table) # for fread, which is the fastest out there. 
survey <- data_frame(
  respondant = c("Andrew", "Zane", "Curtis")
)

setNames(survey, c("leaders", "roosevelt", "wilson", "lenin"))
headings <- fread("leaders.csv")

# I'm not sure if append will work with the new data_frame instead of data.frame
survey.new <- data_frame(append(survey, list(ID = "", age = ""), after =  1))
survey.new
#nope, no likey
#man that's a pain 
```
